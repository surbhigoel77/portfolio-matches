Our flagship event is Crisis at Christmas, where we open homeless shelters during the Christmas period where many other homelessness facilities close and the homeless population face loneliness during the festive period. We provide shelter, warmth, food and drink, activities and entertainment, Internet Cafe, international phone calls, and most importantly advice services to get people out of homelessness for good.There's a ton of IT that goes on: We need internet connectivity to run our centres (and to provide our clients with Wi-Fi), software to manage everything that goes on in a centre like inventory / incidents / client relationships, making sure we have enough IT supplies like hardware (desktops, tablets and printers), and the list goes on. On top of that, we need a robust service desk to help our (also volunteer) users if they run into issue with IT.We would appreciate any volunteers in any IT specialities (hardware, software, SRE, VoIP, tech support, etc) in any level (student, starting out or years in the field) to join us and help out with developing and maintaining IT solutions to ensure our event is a success and lift people out of homelessness. As a volunteer at Crisis myself, I've learnt a lot of things I wouldn't have a chance to do in my real job, and that's what makes it interesting to volunteer here.I can be reached at timothy.choi (at) crisis.org.uk if you have questions or would like to know more."

We offer a comprehensive set of tools that help our Fortune 500 clients understand and improve how they\u2019re perceived in the marketplace, how aware consumers are of the value they provide, and how much consumers trust them to provide the value they promise. We've been rapidly expanding our list of enterprise customers and deepening our integrations with \"household name\" partners like Amazon and Clorox. As we grow, we need engineers to help us build even more unique, differentiated, valuable, scalable, and robust analytical SaaS tools and products.About the Role:We are looking for an Adtech-experienced engineer who\u2019s excited about doing the wide variety of technical work that modern SaaS startups need. That includes backend web development (JVM frameworks), frontend SPA development (mostly React), AWS-based cloud engineering, and some data engineering. We are also particularly interested in someone who knows (or is interested in learning) the intricacies of our industry and our business and who is comfortable leading conversations with customers and partners to scope, define, and execute the technical integrations that have become one of our major levers of growth. We're not fixated on years of experience, but this role is unlikely to be right for someone with less than 10. Our team emphasizes high-quality, high-velocity, sustainable software development in a collaborative and inclusive team environment. We\u2019re a small team that gives our engineers a lot of autonomy and empowerment, and we want people who are excited to step in to learn whatever skills or technologies are needed, to contribute wherever in the R&D process they're needed, and to grow their careers by taking on pivotal responsibilities early in their tenure.If you are interested, email me directly: matus@upwave.com or check out the specific role https://www.upwave.com/job/6815819002/"

        "description": "In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that\u2019s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1/5 of our Nation\u2019s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can\u2019t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we\u2019re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.How can this be, and how can we change it?Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn\u2019t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn\u2019t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn\u2019t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn\u2019t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna\u2019s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system\u2019s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.In 2022, Nuna will power over $70Bn of healthcare payments for over 6.5mn patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry\u2019s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.
